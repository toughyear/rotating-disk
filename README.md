- [X] Looping lines effect:
  - copy the elements twice so that looping effect is seamless.
  - animate using `linear infinite` and 100% of size of the element to keep it going in the desired direction.
- [X] Create an imaginary circle with radius r and which as a portion of radius (d) inside the container (overflow hidden).
  - Arrange the lines along the arc of this circle depending on the Y position.
  - get the X using maths logic!
     

 

## TODO
- [ ] change angles of each lines as they scroll down.
